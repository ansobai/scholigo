            A Pomodoro Timer is a time-management tool that breaks work into
            intervals, typically 25 minutes of focused work followed by a
            5-minute break. After completing four work sessions, a longer break
            of 15â€“30 minutes is taken. This technique, known as the Pomodoro
            Technique, helps improve concentration and productivity by balancing
            work and rest, preventing burnout, and making tasks more manageable.
